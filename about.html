<p>Hi! My name is Javier and I'm a web developer.</p>

<p>
    I would like to tell you something about me. I started to develop professional software around the year 2000,
    the Internet at that time was still precarious and websites were made with HTML/CSS and little or no javascript,
    the king was Flash. In all this years a lot of changes comes and in our days nobody think in the web in the same way.
    Now we have a lot of technologies for every minimal part of the software development. I love this changes and the adaptation
    I had to do for being part of all of this, It was a continously learning process that (I think) each professional of this sector
    must to accept, to love and to be passionated for this.

<p>In the <a href="{{ site.path }}/skills">skills</a> page I tried to show all the technologies that cross in my path, you will know my expertise better.</p>

<p>As you can see the site is using some look & feel from known terminal software (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dselect" target="_blank">dselect</a>).</p>

<p>The title of the portfolio comes from my favourite TV show "Supernatural".</p>
