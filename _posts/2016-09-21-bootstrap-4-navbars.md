When I was using this feature from the Bootstrap 4 I found an annoying effect with the collapsing examples on the docs.

The desirable behaviour was:
- My toggle button on the right side (when xs size)
- My menu on the right (when sm and up)
- My collapsed menu on the left (when xs size)

Finally I came to this solution:

There is a gist for this code on:
